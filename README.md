## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this application locally, you'll need:

- Visual Studio 2022 or later
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- .NET 8 SDK
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge recommended)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Design Approach

Agri-Energy Connect follows a user-centric design approach with:

- **Responsive Design** - Fully responsive for desktop and mobile devices
- **Color Scheme** - Various shades of green to reflect the agricultural and sustainable energy focus
- **User-Friendly Interface** - Intuitive navigation and clear visual hierarchy
- **Accessibility** - Designed with accessibility in mind for all users

### Cloning the Project

1. Open your command line interface (CLI)
2. Navigate to your desired directory
3. Run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/st10251759/PROG7313-POE-PART-2.git
```

4. Open the solution file (AgriEnergyConnect.sln) in Visual Studio
5. Restore NuGet packages
6. Build the solution

### Restoring the Database

You can choose between these two methods to restore the database.

#### Method 1: Using the Backup (.bak) File

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
2. Right-click on "Databases" in the Object Explorer
3. Select "Restore Database..."
4. Choose "Device" as the source
5. Click the "..." button to browse for the backup file
6. Navigate to the backup file in the project's Database folder
7. Select the file and click "OK"
8. Click "OK" to restore the database

#### Method 2: Using the Generated Script

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
2. Connect to your server
3. Click "New Query"
4. Open the SQL script file from the project's Database folder
5. Execute the script to create and populate the database
6. Verify that the database has been created successfully

#### Updating Your Connection String

After restoring the database, you'll need to tell the application where to find it:

1. Open the project in Visual Studio
2. Find the `appsettings.json` file in the Solution Explorer
3. Locate the "ConnectionStrings" section
4. Update the connection string to match your SQL Server details:
   <pre> ```json { "ConnectionStrings": { "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=Prog7311Db;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;TrustServerCertificate=True" } } 
   ``` </pre>

5. Replace `YOUR_SERVER_NAME` with your local SQL Server name (typically your computer name followed by `\SQLEXPRESS` or `\MSSQLSERVER`)
6. Save the file

> **Tip for beginners**: To find your server name, open SQL Server Management Studio. The server name you used to connect will be shown in the "Connect to Server" dialog or at the top of Object Explorer.

## Architecture and Design Pattern

### Model-View-Controller (MVC)

Agri-Energy Connect employs the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern as its architectural foundation, providing a clean separation of concerns:

- **Models:** Handle data structures and business logic (e.g., `ApplicationUser`, `Product`)
- **Views:** Present information to users with role-specific organization (e.g., `/Views/Farmer/`, `/Views/Admin/`)
- **Controllers:** Manage user input and application flow (e.g., `FarmerController`, `EmployeeController`)

This approach enables straightforward routing and consistent handling of user interactions based on roles.

### Layered Architecture

The application follows a **3-Tier Layered Architecture** for improved maintainability:

- **Presentation Layer:** User interface components and views
- **Business Logic Layer:** Controllers and services handling application operations
- **Data Access Layer:** Entity Framework and `DbContext` managing database operations

This separation of concerns allows changes in one layer to occur without disrupting others. For example, all database operations are isolated in the `Prog7311DbContext` class, while validation logic remains in the business layer. This organization made it simpler to implement features like role-based access and user management while keeping the codebase organized and adaptable.

## Database Implementation

### SQL Server and Entity Framework Core

Agri-Energy Connect uses **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** as its database engine, connected through **Entity Framework Core**. This combination was selected for:

- **Reliability:** Stable performance for handling multiple concurrent users
- **Structured storage:** Efficient organization of relational data (Users, Products, Roles, Categories)
- **ASP.NET integration:** Seamless compatibility with the application framework

Entity Framework Core serves as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), allowing:
- Code-first migrations
- Automated data validation
- Reduced need for manual SQL queries

The database schema is designed to support scalability, with the `Prog7311DbContext` class acting as the bridge between application code and data storage. This implementation ensures data integrity while maintaining security for sensitive user information, and provides a straightforward workflow for future enhancements and expansions.
